# Minimal Dependency Web Sunmap

An exercise in simplifying build and deploy of a Sunmap visualization.

- build without any tool installation:
use  cljs.jar  (ClojureScript 1.11.60  downloaded 2022 Nov 21)
```
$ java -cp "cljs.jar:src" cljs.main --optimizations advanced -c mnd-snmp.main
```
  - local test with included server and browser
```
$ java -cp "cljs.jar" cljs.main --serve
```

- deploy: push Git repo to GitHub repo where  GitHub Pages  enabled

```
...
$ git add   index.html  main.js  worldmap.jpg  worldmap_night.jpg
$ git commit -m "..."
$ git push -u origin main
```
